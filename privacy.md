# Privacy Notice

## Stored Data

This extension collects images, screenshots, and authentication information in order to fulfill its purpose as an imgur rehosting service. Images and screenshots will never be transmitted to any servers except those owned by Imgur, Inc. Information about the images uploaded, including URLs, delete hashes, and thumbnails, may be stored locally on your computer.

## Passwords

This extension follows the OAuth standard for logging in to your imgur account (if configured). Therefore, this extension does not have access to your password, and all associated authentication tokens are stored only on your computer.

In order to complete certain reauthentication actions securely, a token will be sent to a server owned by the extension author. No data is collected about this request, it is merely a passthrough proxy to imgur's servers.

All authentication data is transmitted securely through HTTPS in all circumstances.

## Additional Notices

While this document outlines the data collected by the extension author, the use of this extension necessarily relies on Imgur, Inc.'s service. The information collected by Imgur, Inc. falls under their privacy policy available [here](https://imgur.com/privacy). 

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy please contact the extension author via email or submit an issue on github.
